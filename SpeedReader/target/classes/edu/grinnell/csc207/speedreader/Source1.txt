Bangor Celtic were founded in 1987 as a breakaway club from Cashel Villa. They were originally located at the playing 
field of Good Shepherd School in Rathfarnham. They first entered the FAI Cup in the 1998–99 season, playing their first game in the
 competition on 10 January 1999. The following season they won their first FAI Cup match, beating Ballymun United away from home.
By the 21st century, the club were playing their Leinster Senior League games at the Iveagh Grounds in Drimnagh. 
They won their first Leinster Senior League Senior Division league title in 2005 and their second in 2009. In 2006, 
they qualified for the FAI Cup, making it to the second round. They also reached the 2006–07 final of the FAI Intermediate 
Cup but lost to Avondale United. In 2019, Bangor Celtic merged with Greenhills/Greenpark F.C. and left the Iveagh Grounds to move
 to Greenhills Park in Greenhills.
In 2022, Bangor again qualified for the FAI Cup.
Bangor Celtic have been used as a feeder club to League of Ireland Premier Division side Bohemians.
