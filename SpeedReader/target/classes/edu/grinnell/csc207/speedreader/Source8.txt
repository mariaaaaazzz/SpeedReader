The first known marimba dates back to 1545 in the Santa Lucía hacienda, in the municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas. According to 
documentation dated October 9, 1545, the encomendero Don Pedro Gentil de Bustamante and owner of the hacienda of Santa Lucia,
 describes in his chronicle a marimba in a celebration of Indians; and tells us the following:.

    "...said instrument is composed of eight slats of red wood, unequal in size, which are pierced together with cord and produce joyful 
    echoes with boards of the macaguil (macagüil) stick (...) rows of boards tied to short orchestras (sic) flanged and stretched under 
    said instrument a hole in the ground and glued with resin on the boards snake rattles that make musical vibrate with blows of two 
    small sticks with black 
    wax head one for each hand... ...that this music is accompanied by a drum of animal skin (...)"

It is believed that xylophones came to America by means of Africans who had been taken to Guatemala and Mexico, although there are also records 
in some Mayan pyramids found in Chiapas and Guatemala. The first documented mention of the marimba in Guatemala (marimba de tecomates), dates from
 November 13, 1680 during the inauguration celebrations of the Santa Iglesia Catedral in Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala.

The modern double keyboard marimba was created in 1892, in Chiapas, Mexico, thanks to the innovation of Corazón de Jesús Borras Moreno, a native
 of the Municipality of Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas, Mexico. In 1897, the current model of marimba was played for the first time in the traditional 
 park of the church of Señor del Pozo, in the same municipality, from that moment it has gone from being a native instrument to a concert instrument.
 A five-octave instrument was first built, and later an 11-octave, huge instrument was built, which was played by 9 elements.
