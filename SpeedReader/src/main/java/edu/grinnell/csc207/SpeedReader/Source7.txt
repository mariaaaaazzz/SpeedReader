The iPhone is a line of smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. that run iOS, the company's own mobile operating system. 
The first-generation iPhone was announced by thenâ€“Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at Macworld 2007, and 
launched later that year. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS versions; the latest announced models
being the iPhone 17, the higher-end iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and the thinner iPhone Air. As of July 2025, more than 3 billion 
iPhones have been sold, and Apple has been the largest vendor of mobile phones since 2023.

The original iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology. Throughout its history, the iPhone has gained larger, 
higher-resolution displays, video-recording functionality, waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to the iPhone 8 and 8 
Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel, with the iPhone 5s and later integrating a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since 
the iPhone X,[note 2] iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition in place 
of Touch ID for authentication, and increased use of gestures in place of the home button for navigation.

The iPhone, which operates using Apple's proprietary iOS software, is one of the two major smartphone platforms in the world, alongside
 Android. The first-generation iPhone was described by Steve Jobs as a "revolution" for the mobile phone industry. The iPhone has been 
 credited with popularizing the slate smartphone form factor, and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or "app economy";
  laying the foundation for the boom of the market for mobile devices. In addition to the apps that come pre-installed on iOS, there
   are nearly 2 million apps available for download from Apple's mobile distribution marketplace, the App Store, as of August 2024.
